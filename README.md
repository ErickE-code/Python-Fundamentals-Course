# Python-Fundamentals-Course
This repository contains the exercises and projects completed during the Python Fundamentals bootcamp at Utel (UCAMP)

## Class Excersice
It conttains the exercises made as homework/challenges

## Project_1
This program is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator that asks the user for their first and last name, age, weight, and height. To make the experience more user-friendly, print() messages were added to guide the user through each step of the process. The data is collected using input(), allowing for a simple and clear interaction.

To ensure that the inputs for age, weight, and height are numeric, validation using try-except was implemented. This prevents errors during the calculation and ensures a smooth user experience by displaying a clear message if the input is invalid.

The BMI is calculated using the formula:
BMI = weight / (height ** 2)
The result is displayed with two decimal places, along with the user's personal information.

So far, I’ve found the bootcamp to be very good. I initially had doubts about whether it would be too basic or too slow, but it’s actually progressing well and doesn’t feel burdensome as an extra activity, even with other responsibilities in our daily lives.

However, I think students could use a bit more encouragement—very few people are sharing the weekly challenges in the group.

## Project_2
In this project, we strengthened the skills learned in Module 2, such as the use of if, else, and elif statements. We also reviewed the use of len().

Personally, I really enjoyed starting to work with multiple variations, like in Exercise 2—it’s helping me see how useful this tool can be.

I also find it very helpful when a sample code is provided to guide us. However, in the second problem, the reference code was very similar to the actual exercise. For me, it’s still a bit challenging to structure a problem from scratch, so having some guidance really makes a difference.


## Project_3
To create this code, I used the support material and ChatGPT, using that example as a base. I wasn’t familiar with some of the functions used in the code, and I had to install a few extensions in order to get it working.

It’s really motivating to start working on more complex topics like randomness and automatic graph generation. I like that the course is covering a wide range of functions and concepts—it keeps things interesting.

# Final Project_Pokedex
I found this project to be the most challenging so far, but also the most complete, as we’re now being introduced to APIs—something extremely useful for connecting our work to external sources of information.

I had some trouble getting the JSON files to save correctly. I think it’s a good program overall, but it could be improved—for example, if I don’t know the exact spelling of the Pokémon’s name, I won’t be able to find it.

I’m really happy with the content of this course.
